# TED Stage Timer

Thanks for using the TED Stage Timer — the same one designed for use
at the TED Conference — to rehearse and time your own TED Talk!

### Get it

The TED Countdown Timer is free to use, and can be accessed through
any Web browser. Using Chrome’s Presentation Mode allows you to focus
only on the timer. If you want to use the Timer like an app on your
mobile device, tap on the share icon (iOS) or menu button (Android)
and select “Add to Home Screen.”

### Use it

To start the Timer, select the duration of your talk (choose any
length up to 90 minutes). Next, press the play button to begin the
countdown. You'll see your remaining time, as well as a progress bar
indicating how much of your total time has elapsed. With one minute
left, you'll see your remaining time turn yellow, and as you run out,
the time will turn red. Feel free to pause the timer - you can either
resume your current countdown, or return to set a new one at any time.

## Offline Functionality as a Progressive Web App

This application is built to run online or offline, using the Workbox "cache-first" strategy as a Progressive Web Application. It's also installable to the home screen via Google Chrome on Android, Windows and Mac, as well as on iOS via Safari share => "add to home screen".

For additional information on how offline capabilities work, start with this article which was used as a guide: https://dev.to/noconsulate/react-pwa-with-workbox-6dl.
